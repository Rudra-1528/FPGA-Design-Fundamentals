# FPGA Design & Verification Journey 🚀
**Tools:** Xilinx Vivado Design Suite | **Language:** Verilog HDL

## 📂 Project Structure & Key Learnings

### 1. Digital Logic Verification
- **Half Adder Design:** Implemented arithmetic logic and verified functionality using manual stimuli and testbenches.
- **Simulation:** Proficient in Behavioral Simulation (Force Clock/Constant) to validate timing diagrams.

### 2. FPGA Architecture & Synthesis
- **RTL vs. Technology Schematics:** Analyzed how Verilog code maps to actual FPGA primitives (LUTs, Flip-Flops).
- **Optimization:** Experimented with **Synthesis Strategies** (Area vs. Power) and analyzed the impact on resource utilization.
- **FSM Design:** Studied Finite State Machine encoding techniques for robust control logic.

### 3. Reporting & Debugging
- Used Verilog System Tasks (`$display`, `$monitor`) to build self-checking testbenches.
- Debugged simulation mismatches in Post-Synthesis functional models.

## 🛠️ Current Status
- [x] Complete FPGA Design Flow (RTL -> Bitstream)
- [x] Synthesis & Implementation Analysis
- [ ] Advanced Timing Constraints (Next Goal)
